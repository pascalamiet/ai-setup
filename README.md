# 🤖 AI Setup 

This repo contains files and instructions for our local AI setup. It gives markdownfiles for subagents and skills, as well as setup instructions, general AI information and other stuff we find useful and want to be able to replicate easily on different systems. It's a way to share and exchange these files easily.
